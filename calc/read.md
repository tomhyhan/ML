## Calculus

**Hard problem => Sum of many small values**

d = Basically think of it as small difference- i.e. tiny change in value (x, A ... )

dA = height \* width
=> dA = x2 \* dx
=> dA / dx = f(x) (the height of the graph at that point)

## Derivative

**Tiny change in the value of a function divided by the tiny change in the input that caused it is what the `derivative` is**

dA / dx is called a derivative of A

ds / dt = rise / run = d distance / d time

Best constant approximation of rate of change around a point; which is a tangent to the slope of a function at that point.

dt / ds (t) `Velocity` = s(t+dt)âˆ’s(t) `distance` / dt `time`

Convention for `d` is that `d` is approacheing 0, and this is where magic happens! As `d` approaches 0, we only need to think about the contant value from a result of `dt / dx (t)` (tiny difference in rise / tiny different in run)

### Different view points of derivative

**Power Rule**

x ** n = (x + dx) ** n = (x +dx)(x +dx)(x +dx)...(x +dx) `n times`

-> x ** n `volume of original square` + n \* x ** (n-1) \* dx `portion of increase in the ouput` + (Multiple of dx \*\* 2), Then, all we care about is the `portion of increase in the ouput` as dx approaching 0

d(x\*\*2) = 2x \* dx

### Chain rule and Product rule

#### SUM RULE

d/dx \* (g(x) + h(x)) = dg/dx + dh/dx

#### Product Rule

df / dx = g(x) \* dh / dx + h(x) \* dg / dx

left d right right d left => think of it area of bot and side rectecgle

#### Function Composition

d / dx \* g(h(x)) = dg / dh \* (h(x)) \* dh / dx \* (x)
